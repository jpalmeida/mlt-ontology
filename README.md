# Formal Specifications of the MLT Multi-Level Theory

This project includes two specification of MLT in order to support the validation and verification of the theory using the Alloy Analyzer.

mlt.als assumes static classification

mlt_dynamicclassification.als is a minor extension of MLT. It indexes the primitive "instance of" predicate with a world variable w, thereby including support for dynamic classification in MLT.
